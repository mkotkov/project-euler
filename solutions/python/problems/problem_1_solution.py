# Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
# we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
# Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

# Solution:
def multiples_of_3_and_5(number):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(number):
        if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
            sum += i
    return sum
